## Hackathon Competitions
### BIRS CIH Hackathon

[BIRS CIH Hackathon](https://careerandinnovationhub.ca/data-science-2021/#hackathon) was a competition where we need to build a visualization dashboard that provides insight into the Canadian and American legislative process. This competition was very interesting because we were only given APIs to fetch the data from IOTO international to build a dashboard within a day. On the other hand this was the reason the competition was quite difficult. My team reached 2nd place! Here is a [link](https://github.com/PANDASANG1231/BIRS_CIH_dashboard) to my solution.

### Wind Turbines Dashboard
[Wind Turbines Dashboard](https://github.com/ubco-mds-2021-labs/dashboard1-group-c/tree/deployment) is a dashboard which will help to visualize the number of turbines in different provinces of Canada. It gave us ideas about the number of wind turbines in Canada province wise and number of wind turbines installed on yearly basis. Here is the [link](https://data551-groupc-milestone4.herokuapp.com/) to the dashboard.
